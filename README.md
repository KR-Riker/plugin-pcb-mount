# plugin-pcb-mount

Hello All,

Douder originaly mentioned this as a possibility for the SS2KND (Narrow Design). This suggestion is to move the circuit for resisitor "up" and eliminate the pin holes.  The case would then have a fence printed (or milled) at the bottom similar to the stepper motor (lid) fence,  which would allow the PCB to be "plugged in" (glue optional).
